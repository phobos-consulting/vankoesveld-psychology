								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>I have a Masters in Clinical Psychology and have been registered with AHPRA (Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency) since 2006. I trained in Western Australia and hold AHPRA endorsement in the area of Clinical Psychology. Please see <a href="https://acpa.org.au/what-is-a-clinical-psychologist/">here</a> for more information about Clinical Psychology.</p>
                                <p>I have experience in working with adult individuals and couples around a broad range of issues including anxiety (including OCD and PTSD), depression and bipolar, relationships, trauma, substance abuse, grief and loss, sexuality and gender identity, parenting concerns, self-esteem, and adjustment. I enjoy working with clients to build a shared understanding of what led to and maintains your concerns, so that together we can move towards the change you are looking for.</p>
                                <p>I work from an evidence-based and client-centred perspective, drawing on training in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Schema Therapy, Mindfulness and Compassion-Based Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Emotion Focussed Therapy for couples, amongst other models. I aim to establish a collaborative, trusting and constructive relationship with clients and am happy to liaise with others involved in your care if you wish.</p>
                                <p>I am a Member of <a href="https://acpa.org.au/">ACPA</a>, the Australian Clinical Psychology Association and am registered with Medicare.</p>

						<!-- Services and Fees -->

								<h2 class="major">Services &amp; Fees</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>I provide individual and couple counselling to adults, by self-referral or via GP referral if you are claiming the Medicare rebate under a Mental Health Treatment Plan. As I also work in the public sector, my availability is currently limited to XYZ. Please contact me to further discuss your concerns and what you are looking for, and I will be glad to suggest some alternative options if we agree that a different service may be more suitable.</p>
                                <p>The standard fee for each session (individual or couple) is $180, with each session lasting 50-60 minutes. Initial Couple sessions of 90 minutes are billed at $220, with standard sessions after the first appointment. Health Care Card holders may request a reduced fee. The APS (Australian Psychological Society) recommended schedule fee is $251.</p>
                                <p>With a GP Mental Health Treatment Plan, you may be able to claim a Medicare rebate of $124.50 for up up to 10 sessions, but at present my practice does not have facilities to claim directly from Medicare so you will need to pay the full fee and claim back from Medicare. Please see <a href="https://www.psychology.org.au/for-the-public/Medicare-rebates-psychological-services/Medicare-FAQs-for-the-public">here</a> for more information on Medicare rebates.</p>
                                <p>I understand that cancellations are sometimes necessary, however cancellations of less than 24 hours notice can generally not be refilled and so will incur a 50% fee ($90), non-rebatable.</p>
                                <p>Please contact your private health cover to ascertain if a rebate is payable under your particular cover.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Supervision</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>I am registered with AHPRA as a supervisor for Psychologists and Clinical Psychologists, including registration as a primary supervisor for Clinical Psychology Registrars. I have engaged in supervisory work since 2010 and have attended training with Michael Carroll and Daphne Hewson, with a focus on reflective practice. I am happy to speak with you to discuss your supervisory needs and can book an initial session to assess 'fit' if you would like to.</p>
                                <p>Fees for supervision are currently $160/hour, with session time and location by negotiation.</p>
