                                <h3>Kate van Koesveld</h3>
                                <p>I have a Masters in Clinical Psychology and have been registered with the Psychology Board of Australia since 2006. I trained in Western Australia and hold endorsement in the area of Clinical Psychology. Please see <a href="https://acpa.org.au/Web/Web/CP/What-is-a-Clinical-Psychologist.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about Clinical Psychology.</p>
                                <p>I have experience in working with adult individuals and couples around a broad range of issues including anxiety, trauma, depression and bipolar disorder, relationships, OCD, alcohol misuse, ADHD, grief and loss, sexuality and gender identity, self-esteem, and adjustment to major life changes. I enjoy working with clients to build a shared understanding of what led to and maintains your concerns, so that together we can move towards the change you are looking for. I work as a solo practitioner (in a group of consulting rooms) and so do not offer after hours or crisis support, but I am happy to collaborate with your GP, psychiatrist, or others involved in your care.</p>
                                <p>I work from an evidence-based and client-centred perspective, drawing on training in various models including Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Schema Therapy, Mindfulness and Compassion-Focussed Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing), DBR (Deep Brain Reorienting), and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, along with Emotion Focussed and Gottman therapies for couples. I previously worked for 13 years in the government sector with military and ex-military personnel and their families, and I continue to enjoy working with this group of clients. I enjoy both brief and longer-term work and am generally available in private practice 4 days per week (business hours).</p>
								<p>I am a Full Member of <a href="https://acpa.org.au/" target="_blank">ACPA</a> (the Australian Clinical Psychology Association), <a href="https://icp.org.au/" target="_blank">ICP</a> (Institute of Clinical Psychologists), and <a href="https://emdraa.org" target="_blank">EMDRAA</a> (EMDR Association of Australia). I am registered with Medicare and most private health funds. I work with the veteran community on referral from Bupa and Open Arms or via private self-referral.</p>

						<!-- Services and Fees -->
							<article id="servicesandfees">
								<h2 class="major">Services &amp; Fees</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/water.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I provide individual and couple counselling to adults, either by self-referral or via GP referral if you are claiming the Medicare rebate. I also accept referrals from some services specific to military and ex-military families, please feel free to ask me about this process if you are unsure.</p>
								<p>The standard fee for new clients (individual or couple) is $260 per session (50-55 min), or $320 for 90 minute sessions. With a GP Mental Health Treatment Plan, you may be able to claim a Medicare rebate of $141.85 for up to 10 sessions per calendar year. Some private health funds also provide rebates, although the amount varies between funds.</p>
								<p>Generally the first session is used to better understand your reasons for seeking therapy and to see if I am the right 'fit' for you, but you are also welcome to contact me before you book an appointment if you have any questions. I have an information document which answers most common queries, and some brief initial paperwork I collect from new clients, which I send via email.</p>
								<p>Sessions are generally held in-person at my office in Subiaco. If you prefer telehealth (phone or video sessions), this is also an option. Generally rebates apply as usual for telehealth sessions.</p>

							<article id="supervision">
								<h2 class="major">Supervision</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/river.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am registered with the Psychology Board of Australia as a supervisor for Psychologists and Clinical Psychologists, including as a primary supervisor for Clinical Psychology Registrars. I have engaged in supervisory work since 2010, with a focus on reflective practice.</p>
