                                <h3>Kate van Koesveld</h3>
                                <p>I have a Masters in Clinical Psychology and have been registered with the Psychology Board of Australia since 2006. I trained in Western Australia and hold endorsement in the area of Clinical Psychology. Please see <a href="https://acpa.org.au/what-is-a-clinical-psychologist/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information about Clinical Psychology.</p>
                                <p>I have experience in working with adult individuals and couples around a broad range of issues including anxiety, trauma, depression and bipolar disorder, relationships, OCD, substance abuse, grief and loss, sexuality and gender identity, parenting concerns, self-esteem, and adjustment. I enjoy working with clients to build a shared understanding of what led to and maintains your concerns, so that together we can move towards the change you are looking for.</p>
                                <p>I work from an evidence-based and client-centred perspective, drawing on training in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Schema Therapy, Mindfulness and Compassion-Based Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, EMDR,  and Emotion Focussed Therapy for couples, amongst other models. I aim to establish a collaborative, trusting and constructive relationship with clients and am happy to liaise with others involved in your care if you wish. I enjoy both brief and long-term work and have worked for over 10 years in the government sector with military families.</p>
                                <p>I am a Member of <a href="https://acpa.org.au/" target="_blank">ACPA</a>, the Australian Clinical Psychology Association, as well as the AACBT (Australian Association for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) and ASTSS (Australasian Society for Traumatic Stress Studies). I am registered with Medicare and most private health funds.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Services &amp; Fees</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/water.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>I provide individual and couple counselling to adults, by self-referral or via GP referral if you are claiming the Medicare rebate. As I also work in the public sector, my availability is currently limited to Mondays at my consulting room in Subiaco. Please contact me to discuss your concerns and what you are looking for from therapy.</p>
							    <p>The standard fee for each session (individual or couple) is $180, with each session lasting around 50 minutes. With a GP Mental Health Treatment Plan, you may be able to claim a Medicare rebate of $124.50 for up to 10 sessions per calendar year. Some private health funds also provide rebates.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/river.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                <p>I am registered with the Psychology Board of Australia as a supervisor for Psychologists and Clinical Psychologists, including as a primary supervisor for Clinical Psychology Registrars. I have engaged in supervisory work since 2010 and have attended training with Michael Carroll and Daphne Hewson, with a focus on reflective practice.</p>
                                <p>Fees for supervision are currently $160/hour, with session time and location by negotiation.</p>
